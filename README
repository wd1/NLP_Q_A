IMPORTANT:
As the libraries for running the code were too large, we uploaded them on a google drive. The link to the drive is given below:
https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B1YcnxviPBSEU3NsWUZEMnR1Wm8
The file is named lib.tar.gz. Extract it, it will create a folder lib. Copy the directory to /Code/dist/
Requirements:
1. Oracle Java 8 with JavaPath set.
2. Apache2 web server installed and running.


Running the Code through the terminal:
We have implemented two models. Both the models use the following files present in location Code/:  
1. Question (question.txt) - Put the question you want answered here.
2. Document (story.txt) - Put the document that would be used for answering here.
3. Output File location (answer.txt) - The answer to the question will be stored in this file. Open it when the code finishes.


	Running Model 1 (Graph Based Model): 
		a.Open the folder Code/dist/Model1/
		b.After putting the question and the document in the respective files, run the following command on the terminal:
			sh run.sh
		c.Once the code is done executing, the output will be in answer.txt (mentioned above)

	Running Model 2 (Key Word Based Model): 
		a.Open the folder Code/dist/Model2/
		b.After putting the question and the document in the respective files, run the following command on the terminal:
			sh run.sh
		c.Once the code is done executing, the output will be in answer.txt (mentioned above)
