Gravity makes water flow down. 
But in narrow spaces, water can go in any direction across a horned Lizard's back or even up the side of a thorny Lizard. 
Water is made up of tiny units called molecules. 
Water molecules act like magnets, sticking to one another and to some surfaces. 
Water can rise through a narrow channel as molecules at the top stick to the channel surface and pull other molecules up from below. 
To see this effect, touch the tip of a narrow tube, such as a straw from a boxed juice drink, to the surface of some water. 
The water will rise into the straw.
