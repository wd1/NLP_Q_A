A house is a place where we live. 
My house is very big. 
I live in my house with my parents and sister.
My house has bedrooms, bathrooms, kitchen, prayer room and dining room. 
The best place in my house is my bedroom. 
There is big teddy bear in my room. 
I hug my teddy bear when I sleep. 
When my friends come, we play together in my room. 
There is a beautiful garden in front of my house.
There are trees around my house.
I like my house very much.
