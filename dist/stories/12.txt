Sun gives us light. 
My teacher says that it is a ball of fire. 
So it keeps us warm and gives us heat. 
My mother dries our clothes in Sun. 
Plants make their food with the help of sunlight. 
When Sun rises it becomes day and when it sets it becomes night. 
Sun rises in the East and sets in the West. 
Every day morning I look at the sun through my window. 
Sun rises early in the morning even before I get up. 
I like a sunny day as I can play outside with my friends. 
If there is no Sun it will be dark everywhere. 
So I like Sun very much.
