Once upon a time, there was a farmer. 

Farmer had Sons, they were lazy and idle. 

They often quarreled among themselves. 

Farmer was very much annoyed with it.

So Farmer called his Sons and told them that since his end was near, he wanted to teach them a lesson. 

So he told them that since his end was near, he wanted to give them a useful piece of advice.

He sent for a bundle of sticks, it was brought. 

He asked all his Sons turn by turn to break the bundle of the sticks. 

All tried hard, but none of them was able to break the bundle.

Then he asked one of them to untie the bundle. 

This was also done immediately. 

Then he asked each of them to break the sticks individually. 

Now each one succeeded in doing so.
