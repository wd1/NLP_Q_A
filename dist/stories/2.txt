Once, a Hare saw a Tortoise walking slowly with a heavy shell on his back. 
Hare was very proud of himself.
He asked Tortoise for a race.
Tortoise agreed. 
They started the running race. 
Hare ran very fast. 
But Tortoise walked very slowly. 
Hare rested under a tree and soon slept off. 
But Tortoise walked slowly and steadily and reached the goal. 
At last, Tortoise won the race.
