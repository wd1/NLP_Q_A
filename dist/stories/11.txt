My favorite teacher is Anitha. 
She is my class teacher.
She is strict but funny. 
She cracks lots of jokes when she teaches. 
She teaches us good songs. 
She gives us sweets on her birthday and festivals. 
We all stay quiet when she teaches. 
She makes sure that we understand the subject very well.
At the end of the class Maâ€™m asks us questions. 
Most of my friends also like her very much.
She is very caring and lovely.
We wish her all good things in her life.
