My favourite flower is Shoe. 
I chose Shoe because of its simple shape.
It is seen in different colours like red, pink, yellow, white etc.
I like the red Shoe the most.
It has five petals.
Its long stem looks like a thing popping out from the centre which contains yellow pollen. 
Shoe is also known as hibiscus.
It is very nice to see butterflies coming and sucking nectar from Shoe .
The leaves of Shoe are good for the hair.
My mother grinds leaves of Shoe flower and mixes it with the water to make shampoo.
She uses it for washing hair.
I have beautiful hair because I use hibiscus shampoo.
A Shoe is a beauty to any garden with its different colours.
