I have a pet rabbit.
We call her, Bunny.
She is very cute.
She plays with me.
She hops when she is happy.
We play running race.
She runs very fast and wins.
She loves to eat carrots.
I keep her in a big and beautiful basket.
Every day morning when I get up I run to the basket to greet my bunny.
When I call her, she shakes her ears and looks at me with her beautiful eyes.
I love my pet rabbit very much.
