She lived in the folds of the exquisite white silk sheet that covered the bed of a king in a certain country.
She fed on the king's blood without anybody noticing, and was happy to spend her days.
One day, Bug managed to enter the beautifully decorated bedroom of the king.
When Flea saw him, she warned Bug to leave the before he get caught.
Bug didn't agree. asked for permission.
Flea told him to wait till King fall asleep.
Bug agreed.
Soon after they decided on such terms, King came to his bedroom and lay down to sleep.
Bug could not control himself, and decided to take a tiny bite of the King, without waiting. 
As King was yet to fall asleep, he jumped at the sharp bite of Bug.
King shouted at his servants.
On hearing this, Bug quickly hid himself in a corner of the bed, before the servants could start searching for him.
However, the servants scrutinized the entire bed, sheet by sheet, and found Flea between the folds. 
They killed her at once, and King went to sleep without anymore worries.
