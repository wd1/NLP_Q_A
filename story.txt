A neighbour is the one who lives near or next to your house. 
My neighbour is Preethi. 
She is very kind to me. 
My neighbour gives me chocolates whenever I visit her. 
Her hobbies are gardening and cooking.  
She makes good cookies and cakes. 
My neighbour has a lovely garden with lots of flowers like tulips, roses, lillies etc. 
She has three kids. 
I love playing with my neighbour.
She takes me to places like amusement parks, beaches, zoo etc.  
She takes care of me whenever my parents go out. 
Sometimes she plays with me. 
She helps me in my studies whenever my mother is busy at home. 
You should love your neighbour as yourself.
